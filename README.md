##Week 1
- Usual classroom Introduction
- Got introduced to an Unusual Course (DISMATH)
- I learned that i need to learn how to learn
- Introduced to the Different kinds of Truths
- Got dizzy on the Knights and Knaves problem
- Propositions are statments that can be answered by true or false
- Logical Symbols were taught
- Recalled how to use truth tables

##Week 2
- Learned the 2 types of Quantifiers: Existential and Universal
- Predicate logic that separates the statement into subject and predicate
- Learned the Rules of Inference
- Tautology: True for all
- Superman Does not Exist :(

##Week 3
- Proved a lot of stuff
- Directly Proven Stuffs
- Indirectly Proven other stuffs (with contraposition)
- Some problems cant be solved by both direct and indirect (So Choose Wisely)
- Vacuous and Trivial Proofs make some things easier


##Week 4
- Proofs by Equivalences are usually long
- Learned mathematical induction
- Remembered to pay attention to small details
- People with Photographic memory are exempted from taking down notes
- Introduced to Reclusive functions
- Proved Summation Theorems

##Week5
- Recursive Algorithim, a step by step procedure wherein we are given inputs that will have an output and that output will be the input for the next step.
- Checking for Program Corectness was taught.
- Hoare Triple as a way to check the validity of a program was taught.
- Sets was re-taught to me this week.

##Week 6
- Cardinality, the number of distinct elements in the set, was taught.
- Different types of Functions were taught.

##Week 7
- No classes
- Very Sad

##Week 8
- In-depth discussion about algorithms.
- Pseudocode is like the commmon language between programmers.

##Week 9
- Searching Algorithms such as Binary and Linear Search were taught.

##Week 10
- Sorting Algorithms such as Bubble and Insert Sort were taught.
- Greedy Algorithm was also taught.
- Growth of Functions, Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta was Introduced.
- Complexity of functions is known for the Big Theta of the Function.


##Week 11
- No Class Week
- Sad Again

##Week 12
- Graphs were taught.
- Handshake Theorem was given to know the number of edges of a graph.
- Mind Boggling Euler Paths and Circuits, and Hamiltonian Paths and Circuits were taught.
- Representation of Graphs through matrices was shown.
- Isomorphic Graphs are equivalent.

##Week 13
- In Depth discussion on homeomorphism was made.
- Four Color Theorem on Planar Graphs was taught.
- Trees are like real trees but uprooted and rotated.
- Unexpected relation between DISMATH and Language was made.
- Automata was taught.

##Additional Readings
- Tree traversal - Visiting Every vertex of an ordered root tree.
- Spanning Trees - a subgraph of a certain graph that is a tree that contains all vertices.
- Relations - relationship of elements between two sets.
- Binary relation -  from A to B is a subset of A x B.
- Reflexive relation - if (a,a) is an element of R (relation) for every element a in set A.
- Symmetric relation - if (b,a) is an element of R whenever (a,b) is an element of R, for all a,b in set A; antisymmetric - if a = b.
- Transitive relation- whenever (a,b) and (b,c) are elements of R, then (a.c) is an element of R; a,b,c are in set A.
- Composite (S o R) - (a,b) and (b,c) such that (a,c), from sets A, B, C.
- n-ary relation - relationship of elements from more than two sets; A1 x A2 x An where A - domains and n - degree. 
- Equivalence relation - a relation that is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
- Equivalencee class (of a) - set of all elements that are related to an element a of A.
- Partial ordering - A reflective, antisymmetric and transitive relation on a set S; poset - partially ordered set.
- Lexicographic order - based in the ordering of the letters in the alphabet
- Lattices - a partially unordered set in which every pair of elements has both a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound.
